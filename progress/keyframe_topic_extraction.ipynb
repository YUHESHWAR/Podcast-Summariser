The following is a conversation with Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company behind GPT4, ChatGPT, Dall? E, Codex, and many other AI technologies which, both individually and together, constitute some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of artificial intelligence, computing and humanity in general. Please allow me to say a few words about the possibilities and the dangers of AI in this current moment in the history of human civilization. I believe it is a critical moment. We stand on the precipice of fundamental societal transformation, where soon nobody knows when, but many, including me, believe it's within our lifetime. The collective intelligence of the human species begins to pale in comparison by many orders of magnitude to the general superintelligence in the AI systems we build and deploy at scale. This is both exciting and terrifying. It is exciting because of the innumerable applications we know and don't yet know that will empower humans to create, to flourish, to escape the widespread poverty and suffering that exists in the world today and and to succeed in that old, all too human pursuit of happiness. It is terrifying because of the power that superintelligent AGI wields to destroy human civilization intentionally or unintentionally. The power to suffocate the human spirit in the totalitarian way of George Orwell's 1984, or\n",

      "this pressure that there's going to be a lot of open source, there's going to be a lot of large language models under this pressure, how do you continue prioritizing safety versus I mean there's several pressures. So one of them is a market driven pressure from other companies, Google, Apple, Meta and smaller companies. How do you resist the pressure from that or how do you navigate that pressure? You stick with what you believe and you stick to your mission. You know, I'm sure people will get ahead of us in all sorts of ways and take shortcuts we're not going to take and we just aren't going to do that. How do you out compete them? I think there's going to be many AGIs in the world so we don't have to like out compete everyone. We're going to contribute one, other people are going to contribute some, I think multiple AGIs in the world with some differences in how they're built and what they do and what they're focused on. I think that's good. We have a very unusual structure so we don't have this incentive to capture unlimited value. I worry about the people who do but you know, hopefully it's all going to work out. But we're a weird org and we're good at resisting. Like we have been a misunderstood and badly mocked org for a long time. Like when we started we like announced the org at the end of 2015, said we were going to work on AGI. Like people thought we were batshit insane. Yeah, you know, like I, I remember at the time a eminent AI scientist at a large industrial AI lab was like DMing individual reporters being like, you know, these people aren't very good and it's ridiculous to talk about AGI and I can't believe you're giving them time of day.

So OpenAI and DeepMind was a small collection of folks who are brave enough to talk about AGI in the face of mockery. We don't get mocked as much now. Don't get mocked as much now. So speaking about the structure of the, of the, of the org. So OpenAI went stop being nonprofit or split up in 20. Can you describe that whole process, how things stand? We started as a nonprofit. We learned early on that we were going to need far more capital than we were able to raise as a nonprofit. Our nonprofit is still fully in charge. There is a subsidiary capped profit so that our investors and employees can earn a certain fixed return. And then beyond that everything else flows to the nonprofit. And the nonprofit is like in voting control. Lets us make a bunch of nonstandard decisions, can cancel equity, can do a whole bunch of other things, can let us merge with another org, protects us from making decisions that are not in any shareholders interest. So I think as a structure that has been important to a lot of the decisions we've made. What went into that decision process for taking a leap from nonprofit to capped for profit? What are the pros and cons you were deciding at the time? I mean this was, it was really like to do what we needed to go do. We had tried and failed enough to raise the money as a nonprofit. We didn't see a path forward there. So we needed some of the benefits of capitalism, but not too much. I remember at the time someone said, you know, as a nonprofit, not enough will happen. As a for profit, too much will happen. So we need this sort of strange intermediate. Well, you kind of had this offhand comment of you worry about the uncapped companies that play with AGI. Can you elaborate on the worry here? Because\n",

      "about like tension, the competition, but you don't know that's not happening inside one model. Yeah, that's true. It'd be nice. It'd be nice if whether it's engineered in or revealed to be happening, it'd be nice for it to be happening. That and of course it can happen with multiple AGIs talking to each other or whatever. There's something also about. Stuart Russell has talked about the control problem of always having AGI to be have some degree of uncertainty, not having a dogmatic certainty to it. That feels important. So some of that is already handled with human alignment, human feedback, reinforcement, learning with human feedback. But it feels like there has to be engineered in like a hard uncertainty, humility. You can put a romantic word to it. Yeah. You think that's possible to do the definition of those words? I think the details really matter. But as I understand them, yes, I do. What about the off switch, that like big red button in the data center we don't tell anybody about? I'm a fan. My backpack in your backpack. You think that's possible to have a switch? You think, I mean actually more seriously, more specifically about sort of rolling out of different systems. Do you think it's possible to roll them, unroll them, pull them back in? Yeah, I mean we can absolutely take a model back off the Internet. We can, like, take. We can turn an API off. Isn't that something you worry about, like, when you release it and millions of people are using it and like, you realize, holy crap, they're using it for, I don't know, worrying about the, like, all kinds of terrible use cases. We do worry about that a lot. I mean, we try to figure out with as much red teaming and testing ahead of time as we do how to avoid a lot of those. But I can't emphasize enough how much the collective intelligence and creativity of the world will beat OpenAI and all of the red teamers we can hire. So we put it out, but we put it out in a way we can make changes. In the millions of people that have used ChatGPT and GPT, what have you learned about human civilization in general? I mean, the question I ask is, are we mostly good or is there a lot of malevolence in the human spirit? Well, to be clear, nor does Anyone else at OpenAI said they're reading all the ChatGPT messages, but from what I hear, people using it for at least the people I talk to, and from what I see on Twitter, we are definitely mostly good. But A, not all of us are all of the time, and B, we really want to push on the edges of these systems and, you know, we really want to test out some darker theories for the world. Yeah, it's very interesting. It's very interesting. And I think that's not. That's. That actually doesn't communicate the fact that we're, like, fundamentally dark inside, but we like to go to the dark places in order to maybe rediscover the light. It feels like dark humor is a part of that. Some of the darkest, some of the toughest things you go through, if you suffer in life in a war zone, the people I've interacted with, they're in the midst of a war. They're usually around. Yeah. Joking around. And they're dark jokes. Yep. So that there's something there. I totally agree about that tension. So just to the model, how do you decide what is and isn't misinformation? How do you decide what is true? You actually have OpenAI's internal factual performance benchmark. There's a lot of cool benchmarks here. How do you build a benchmark for what is true? What is truth? Sam Altman, like, math is true, and the origin of COVID is not agreed upon as ground truth. Those are the two things. And\n",

      "on earth would come together, have a really thoughtful, deliberative conversation about where we want to draw the boundary on this system. And we would have something like the US Constitutional Convention where we debate the issues and we look at things from different perspectives and say, well, this would be good in a vacuum, but it needs a check here. And then we agree on, here are the rules, here are the overall rules of this system. And it was a Democratic process. None of us got exactly what we wanted, but we got something that we feel good enough about. And then we and other builders build a system that has that baked in within that. Then different countries, different institutions can have different versions. So, you know, there's like, different rules about, say, free speech in different countries, and then different users want very different things, and that can be within the, you know, like, within the bounds of what's possible in their country. So we're trying to figure out how to facilitate. Obviously, that process is impractical as stated, but what is something close to that we can get to. Yeah, but how do you offload that? So is it possible for OpenAI to offload that onto us humans? No. We have to be involved. Like, I don't think it would work to just say, like, hey, un go do this thing and we'll just take whatever you get back. Because we have like, a, we have responsibility of we're the one putting the system out, and if it breaks, we're the ones that have to fix it or be accountable for it. But B, we know more about what's coming and about where things are harder, easy to do than other people do. So we've got to be involved, heavily involved, and we've got to be responsible in some sense, but it can't just be our input. How bad is the completely unrestricted model? So how much do you understand about that? You know, the. There's been a lot of discussion about free speech absolutism. Yeah. How much if that's applied to an AI system. You know, we've talked about putting out the base model as, at least for researchers or something, but it's not very easy to use everyone's like, give me the base model. And again, we might. We might do that. I think what people mostly want is they want a model that has been rlh deft to the worldview they subscribe to. It's really about regulating other people's speech. Yeah. Like, people are implied, you know, and like, in the debates about what. Shut up. In the Facebook feed, I, having listened to a lot of people talk about that, everyone is like, well, it doesn't matter what's in my feed, because I won't be radicalized. I can handle anything. But I really worry about what Facebook shows you. I would love it if there's some way, which I think my interaction with GPT has already done that some way to, in a nuanced way, present the tension of ideas. I think we are doing better at that than people realize. The challenge, of course, when you're evaluating this stuff is you can always find anecdotal evidence of GPT slipping up and saying something either wrong or biased and so on. But it would be nice to be able to kind of generally make statements about the bias of the system. Generally make statements about there are people doing good work there. You know, if you ask the same question 10,000 times and you rank the outputs from best to worst, what most people see is, of course, something around output 5,000. But the output that gets all of the Twitter Attention is output 10,000. And this is something that I think the world will just have to adapt to with these models, is that sometimes there's a really egregiously dumb answer. And in a world where you click screenshot and share, that might not be representative. Now, already we're noticing a lot more people respond to those things, saying, well, I tried it and got this. And so I think we are building up the antibodies there. But it's a new thing. Do you feel pressure from clickbait journalism that looks at 10,000,\n",

      "throw their computer out a window, but it's sort of nice to know that you can. And it's nice to know that this is a tool very much in my control and this is a tool that does things to help me. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that with GPT4. But I noticed that I have a visceral response to being scolded by a computer and I think, you know, that's a good learning from deploying or from creating the system and we can improve it. Yeah, it's tricky. And also for the system not to treat you like a child. Treating our users like adults is a thing I say very frequently inside, inside the office. But it's tricky. It has to do with language. Like if there's like certain conspiracy theories you don't want the system to be speaking to. It's a very tricky language you should use because what if I want to understand the earth? If the earth is the idea that the earth is flat and I want to fully explore that. I want the. I want GPT to help me explore. GPT4 has enough nuance to be able to help you explore that without and treat you like an adult in the process. GPT3 I think just wasn't capable of getting that right. But GPT4, I think we can get to do this, by the way, if you could just speak to the leap from GPT4 to GPT4 from 3.5, from 3. Is there some technical leaps or is it really focused on the alignment? No, it's a lot of technical leaps in the base model. One of the things we are good at at OpenAI is finding a lot of small wins and multiplying them together and each of them maybe is like a pretty big secret in some sense, but it really is the multiplicative impact of all of them and the detail and care we put into it that gets us these big leaps. And then you know, it looks like to the outside like oh, they just probably like did one thing to get from 3 to 3.5 to 4. It's like hundreds of complicated things. So tiny little thing with the training, with the like everything with the data organization, how we like collect the data, how we clean the data, how we do the training, how we do the optimizer, how we do the architecture. Like so many things. Let me ask you the all important question about size. So the size matter in terms of neural networks with how good the system performs. So GPT3 3.5 had 175 billion. I heard GPT4 at 100 trillion. 100 trillion. Can I speak to this? Do you know that meme? Yeah, the big purple circle. Do you know where it originated? I don't do. I'd be curious to hear. It's the presentation I gave. No way. Yeah, a journalist's just took a snapshot Now I learned from. This is right when GPT3 was released. I gave a. It's on YouTube. I gave a description of what it is and I spoke to the limitations, the parameters and like where it's going. And I talked about the human brain and how many parameters it has, synapses and so on. And perhaps like an idiot, perhaps not. I said like GPT4, like the next as it progresses. What I should have said is GPT N or something. I can't believe that at this came from you that is. But people should go to it. It's totally taken out of context. They didn't reference anything. They took it. This is what GPT4 is going to be. And I feel horrible about it. You know it doesn't it. I. I don't think it matters in any serious way. I mean it's not good because again size is not everything. But also people just take a lot of these kinds of discussions out of context. But it is interesting to comp. I mean that's what I was trying to do to combat to compare in different ways the difference between the human brain and the neural network. And this thing is getting so impressive. This is like in some sense someone said to me this morning actually and I was like oh, this might be right. This is the most complex software object humanity has yet produced. And\n",

      "folks I've interacted with OpenAI, some of the most amazing folks ever met. It takes a lot of time. Like I, I spend, I mean I think a lot of people claim to spend a third of their time hiring I for real, truly do. I still approve every single hire at OpenAI. And I think there's, you know, we're working on a problem that is like very cool and that great people want to work on. We have great people and so people want to be around them. But even with that, I think there's just no shortcut for putting a ton of effort into this. So even when you have the good people, hard work, I think so. Microsoft announced a new multi year, multi billion dollar reported to be $10 billion investment into OpenAI. Can you describe the thinking that went into this? What are the pros, what are the cons of working with a company like Microsoft? It's not all perfect or easy, but on the whole they have been an amazing partner to us. Satya and Kevin and Mikhail are super aligned with us, super flexible, have gone like way above and beyond the call of duty to do things that we have needed to get all this to work. This is like a big iron, complicated engineering project and they are a big and complex company. And I think like many great partnerships or relationships, we've sort of just continued to ramp up our investment in each other and it's been very good. It's a for profit company, it's very driven, it's very large scale. Is there pressure to kind of make a lot of money? I think most other companies wouldn't. Maybe now they would, it wouldn't at the time have understood why we needed all the weird control provisions we have and why we need all the kind of like AGI specialness. And I know that because I talked to some other companies before we did the first deal with Microsoft and I think they are unique in terms of the companies at that scale that understood why we needed the control provisions we have. And so those control provisions help you help make sure that the capitalist imperative does not affect the development of AI. Well, let me just ask you as an aside about Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft. He seems to have successfully transformed Microsoft into, into this fresh, innovative, developer friendly company. I agree. What do you, I mean it's really hard to do for a very large company. What, what have you learned from him? Why do you think he was able to do this kind of thing? Yeah, what insights do you have about why this one human being is able to contribute to the pivot of a large company into something very new. I think most CEOs are either great leaders or great managers. And from what I have observed with Satya, he is both super visionary, really like gets people excited, really makes long duration and correct calls and also he is just a super effective hands on executive and I assume manager too and I think that's pretty rare. I mean Microsoft, I'm guessing like IBM or like a lot of companies have been at it for a while, probably have like old school kind of momentum. So you like inject AI into it. It's very tough. Or anything even like open source, the culture of open source, how hard is it to walk into a room and be like the way we've been doing things are\n",

      "I'm very drawn to that. Have you spent a lot of time interacting with replica or anything similar Replica but also just building stuff myself. I have robot dogs now that I use. I use the, the movement of the, the. The robots to communicate emotion. I've been exploring how to do that. Look, there are going to be very interactive GPT4 powered pets or whatever robots companions and a lot of people seem really excited about that. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting possibilities. I think you'll discover them I think as you go along. That's the whole point. Like the things you say in this conversation. You might in a year say this was right. No, I may totally want. I may turn out that I love my GPT4. Maybe you want a robot or whatever. Maybe you want your programming assistant to be a little kinder and not mock you. No, I think you do want the style of the way GPT4 talks to you. Yes. Really matters. You probably want something different than what I want but we both probably want something different than the current GPT4 and that will be really important even for a very tool like thing. Is there styles of conversation? Oh no. Contents of conversations you're looking forward to with an AGI like GPT 567. Is there stuff where like where do you go to out outside of the fun meme stuff for actual. I mean what I'm excited for is like please explain to me how all of physics works and solve all remaining mysteries. So like a theory of everything. I'll be real happy. Faster than light travel. Don't you want to know? So there's several things to know. It's like and, and be hard. Is it possible and how to do it? Yeah, I want to know. I want to know. Probably the first question would be are there other intelligent alien civilizations out there? But I don't think AGI has the, the ability to do that to, to, to know that might be able to help us figure out how to go detect. And we need to send some emails to humans and say can you run these experiments? Can you build the space probe? Can you wait a very long time or provide a much better estimate than the Drake equation with the knowledge we already have and maybe process all the. Because we've been collecting a lot of. Yeah, maybe it's in the data. Maybe we need to build better detectors which a really advanced AI could tell us how to do it may not be able to answer it on its Own, but it may be able to tell us what to go build to collect more data. What if it says the aliens are already here? I think I would just go about my life. Yeah. Because I mean, a version of that is like, what are you doing differently now that, like, if GPT4 told you and you believed it, okay, AGI is here, or AGI is coming real soon, what are you going to do differently? The source of joy and happiness, of fulfillment in life is from other humans. So it's mostly nothing unless it causes some kind of threat. But that threat would have to be literally a fire. Are we living now with a greater degree of digital intelligence than you would have expected three years ago in the world? And if you could go back and be told by an oracle three years ago, which is blink of an eye, that In March of 2023 you will be living with this degree of digital intelligence, would you expect your life to be more different than it is right now? Probably, Probably. But there's also a lot of different trajectories intermixed. I would have expected the society's response to a pandemic to be much better, much clearer, less divided. I was very confused about. There's a lot of stuff. Given the amazing technological advancements that are happening, the weird social divisions,\n",

It described actual description of who Jordan Peterson is, his career psychologist and so on. It stated that some number of people have called Jordan Peterson a fascist, but there is no factual grounding to those claims. And it described a bunch of stuff that Jordan believes, like he's been an outspoken critic of various totalitarian ideologies and he believes in individualism, individual and various freedoms that contradict the ideology of fascism and so on. And it goes on and on like really nicely. And it wraps it up. It's like it's a college essay. I was like, damn. One thing that I hope these models can do is bring some nuance back to the world. Yes, it felt really nuanced. You know, Twitter kind of destroyed some and maybe we can get some back now. That really is exciting to me. Like, for example, I asked, of course, you know, did. Did the COVID virus leak from a lab? Again, answer, very nuanced. There's two hypotheses. It like, described them. It described the. The amount of data that's available for each. It was like, it was like a breath of fresh air. When I was a little kid, I thought building AI, we didn't really call it AGI at the time. I thought building AI would be like the coolest thing ever. I never, never really thought I would get the chance to work on it. But if you had told me that not only I would get the chance to work on it, but that after making a very, very larval proto AGI thing, that the thing I'd have to spend my time on is trying to argue with people about whether the number of characters it said nice things about one person was different than the number of characters it said nice about some other person. If you hand people an AGI and that's what they want to do, I wouldn't have believed you. But I understand it more now and I do have empathy for it. So what you're implying in that statement is we took such giant leaps on the big stuff and we're complaining or arguing about small stuff. Well, the small stuff is the big stuff in aggregate. So I get it. It's just like I, and I also like, I get why this is such an important issue. This is a really important issue. But that somehow we, like somehow this is the thing that we get caught up in versus like what is this going to mean for our future? Now maybe you say this is critical to what this is going to mean for our future. The thing that it says more characters about this person than this person and who's deciding that and how it's being decided and how the users get control over that. Maybe that is the most important issue. But I wouldn't have guessed it at the time when I was like 8 year old. Yeah, I mean there is, and you do, there's folks at OpenAI, including yourself, that do see the importance of these issues to discuss about them under the big banner of AI safety. That's something that's not often talked about. With the release of GPT4, how much went into the safety concerns, how long also you spend on the safety concern. Can you go through some of that process? Yeah, sure. What went into AI safety considerations of GPT4 release? So we finished last summer. We immediately started giving it to people to red team. We started doing a bunch of our own internal safety evals on it. We started trying to work on different ways to align it and that combination of an internal and external effort plus building a whole bunch of new ways to align the model. And we didn't get it perfect by far. But one thing that I care about is that our degree of alignment increases faster than our rate of capability progress.

      "of the AI safety people you referenced earlier think it's really bad, even they acknowledge that this is of some benefit. But I think any version of one person is in control of this is really bad. So trying to distribute the power I don't have and I don't want like any like super voting power or any special like, then, you know, I know, like control of the board or anything like that of OpenAI. But AGI, if created has a lot of power. How do you think we're doing? Like, honest. How do you think we're doing so far? Like, how do you think our decisions are? Like, do you think we're making things not better or worse? What can we do better? Well, the things I really like because I know a lot of folks at OpenAI. The thing I really like is the transparency. Everything you're saying, which is like failing publicly, writing papers, releasing different kinds of information about the safety concerns involved. Doing it out in the open is great because especially in contrast to some other companies that are not doing that, they're being more closed. That said, you could be more open. Do you think we should open source GPT4? My personal opinion, because I know people are open, AI is no. What is knowing the people that open, I have to do with it because I know they're good people. I know a lot of people, I know they're good human beings. From a perspective of people that don't know the human beings, there's a concern of the super powerful technology in the hands of a few that's closed. It's closed in some sense, but we give more access to it. Yeah. Than like if, if this had just been Google's game, I, I feel it's very unlikely that anyone would have put this API out. There's PR risk with it. Yeah, like I get personal threats because of it all the time. I think most companies wouldn't have done this. So maybe we didn't go as open as people wanted, but like we've distributed it pretty broadly. You personally and OpenAI as a culture is not so like nervous about PR risk and all that kind of stuff. You're more nervous about the risk of the actual technology and you reveal that. So the nervousness that people have is because it's such early days of the technology, is that you will close off over time because more and more powerful. My nervousness is you get attacked so much by fear mongering, clickbait journalism that you're like, why the hell do I need to deal with this? I think the clickbait journalism bothers you more than it bothers me. No, I'm third person bothered. Like, I appreciate that. I feel all right about it. Of all the things I lose sleep over, it's not high on the list because it's important. There's a handful of companies, a handful of folks that are really pushing this forward. They're amazing folks and I don't want them to become cynical about the rest, the rest of the world. I think people at OpenAI feel the weight of responsibility of what we're doing. And yeah, it would be nice if like, you know, journalists were nicer to us and Twitter trolls give us more benefit of the doubt. But like, I think we have a lot of resolve in what we're doing and why and the importance of it. But I really would love, and I ask this, like, of a lot of people, not just if cameras are all in, like, any feedback you've got for how we can be doing better. We're in uncharted waters here. Talking to smart people is how we figure out what to do better. How do you take feedback? Do you take feedback from Twitter also? Because there's the sea, the water. My Twitter is unreadable. Yeah. So sometimes I do. I can, like, take a sample, a cup out of the waterfall. But I mostly take it from conversations like this. Speaking of feedback, somebody you know, well, you work together closely on some of the ideas behind OpenAI is Elon Musk. You have agreed on a lot of things. You've disagreed on some things. What have been some interesting things you've agreed and disagreed on. Speaking of fun debate on Twitter, I\n",

      "when it launched with 3.5 was not something that I certainly felt proud of. It's gotten much better with GPT4. Many of the critics, and I really respect this, have said, hey, a lot of the problems that I had with 3.5 are much better in 4. But also no 2 people are ever going to agree that one single model is unbiased on every topic. And I think the answer there is just going to be to give users more personalized control, granular control over time. And I should say on this point, I've gotten to know Jordan Peterson and I tried to talk to GPT4 about Jordan Peterson and I asked it if Jordan Peterson is a fascist. First of all, it gave context. It described actual description of who Jordan Peterson is, his career psychologist and so on. It stated that some number of people have called Jordan Peterson a fascist, but there is no factual grounding to those claims.

      "that's a real danger. How do you prevent that danger? I think there's a lot of things you can try, but at this point it is a certainty there are soon going to be a lot of capable open source LLMs with very few to none, no safety controls on them. And so you can try with regulatory approaches, you can try with using more powerful AIs to detect this stuff happening. I'd like us to start trying a lot of things very soon. How do you under this pressure that there's going to be a lot of open source, there's going to be a lot of large language models under this pressure, how do you continue prioritizing safety versus I mean there's several pressures. So one of them is a market driven pressure from other companies, Google, Apple, Meta and smaller companies. How do you resist the pressure from that or how do you navigate that pressure? You stick with what you believe and you stick to your mission. You know, I'm sure people will get ahead of us in all sorts of ways and take shortcuts we're not going to take and we just aren't going to do that. How do you out compete them? I think there's going to be many AGIs in the world so we don't have to like out compete everyone. We're going to contribute one, other people are going to contribute some, I think multiple AGIs in the world with some differences in how they're built and what they do and what they're focused on. I think that's good. We have a very unusual structure so we don't have this incentive to capture unlimited value. I worry about the people who do but you know, hopefully it's all going to work out. But we're a weird org and we're good at resisting. Like we have been a misunderstood and badly mocked org for a long time. Like when we started we like announced the org at the end of 2015, said we were going to work on AGI. Like people thought we were batshit insane. Yeah, you know, like I, I remember at the time a eminent AI scientist at a large industrial AI lab was like DMing individual reporters being like, you know, these people aren't very good and it's ridiculous to talk about AGI and I can't believe you're giving them time of day. And it's like that was the level of like pettiness and rancor in the field at a new group of people saying we're going to try to build AGI. So OpenAI and DeepMind was a small collection of folks who are brave enough to talk about AGI in the face of mockery. We don't get mocked as much now. Don't get mocked as much now. So speaking about the structure of the, of the, of the org. So OpenAI went stop being nonprofit or split up in 20. Can you describe that whole process, how things stand? We started as a nonprofit. We learned early on that we were going to need far more capital than we were able to raise as a nonprofit. Our nonprofit is still fully in charge. There is a subsidiary capped profit so that our investors and employees can earn a certain fixed return. And then beyond that everything else flows to the nonprofit. And the nonprofit is like in voting control. Lets us make a bunch of nonstandard decisions, can cancel equity, can do a whole bunch of other things, can let us merge with another org, protects us from making decisions that are not in any shareholders interest. So I think as a structure that has been important to a lot of the decisions we've made. What went into that decision process for taking a leap from nonprofit to capped for profit? What are the pros and cons you were deciding at the time? I mean this was, it was really like to do what we needed to go do. We\n",

      "I don't know how much of that is just the biases of the world I've grow up in and what I have been taught and probably more than I realize. But I think like more individualism, more human will, more ability to self determine is important. And also I think the ability to try new things and not need permission and not need some sort of central planning betting on human ingenuity and this sort of like distributed process I believe is always going to beat centralized planning. And I think that like for all of the deep flaws of America, I think it is the greatest place in the world because it's the best at this. So it's really interesting that centralized planning failed some so in such big ways. But what if hypothetically the centralized planning it was a perfect super intelligent AGI? Super intelligent AGI? Again, it might go wrong in the same kind of ways, but it might not. And we don't really know. We don't really know. It might be better. I expect it would be better. But would it be better than a hundred super intelligent or a thousand super intelligent AGIs sort of in a liberal democratic system arguing yes. Oh man. Now also how much of that can happen internally in one super intelligent AGI? Not so obvious. There is something about. Right, but there is something about like tension, the competition, but you don't know that's not happening inside one model. Yeah, that's true. It'd be nice. It'd be nice if whether it's engineered in or revealed to be happening, it'd be nice for it to be happening. That and of course it can happen with multiple AGIs talking to each other or whatever. There's something also about. Stuart Russell has talked about the control problem of always having AGI to be have some degree of uncertainty, not having a dogmatic certainty to it. That feels important. So some of that is already handled with human alignment, human feedback, reinforcement, learning with human feedback. But it feels like there has to be engineered in like a hard uncertainty, humility. You can put a romantic word to it. Yeah. You think that's possible to do the definition of those words? I think the details really matter. But as I understand them, yes, I do. What about the off switch, that like big red button in the data center we don't tell anybody about? I'm a fan. My backpack in your backpack. You think that's possible to have a switch? You think, I mean actually more seriously, more specifically about sort of rolling out of different systems. Do you think it's possible to roll them, unroll them, pull them back in? Yeah, I mean we can absolutely take a model back off the Internet. We can, like, take. We can turn an API off. Isn't that something you worry about, like, when you release it and millions of people are using it and like, you realize, holy crap, they're using it for, I don't know, worrying about the, like, all kinds of terrible use cases. We do worry about that a lot. I mean, we try to figure out with as much red teaming and testing ahead of time as we do how to avoid a lot of those. But I can't emphasize enough how much the collective intelligence and creativity of the world will beat OpenAI and all of the red teamers we can hire. So we put it out, but we put it out in a way we can make changes. In the millions of people that have used ChatGPT and GPT, what have you learned about human civilization in general?

So OpenAI and DeepMind was a small collection of folks who are brave enough to talk about AGI in the face of mockery. We don't get mocked as much now and don't get mocked as much now. The following is a conversation with Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company behind GPT4, ChatGPT, Dall? E, Codex, and many other AI technologies which, both individually and together, constitute some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of artificial intelligence, computing and humanity in general. Please allow me to say a few words about the possibilities and the dangers of AI in this current moment in the history of human civilization. I believe it is a critical moment. We stand on the precipice of fundamental societal transformation, where soon nobody knows when, but many, including me, believe it's within our lifetime. The collective intelligence of the human species begins to pale in comparison by many orders of magnitude to the general superintelligence in the AI systems we build and deploy at scale. This is both exciting and terrifying. It is exciting because of the innumerable applications we know and don't yet know that will empower humans to create, to flourish, to escape the widespread poverty and suffering that exists in the world today and and to succeed in that old, all too human pursuit of happiness. It is terrifying because of the power that superintelligent AGI wields to destroy human civilization intentionally or unintentionally. The power to suffocate the human spirit in the totalitarian way of George Orwell's 1984, or the pleasure fueled mass hysteria of Brave New World, where, as Huxley saw it, people come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think. That is why these conversations with the leaders, engineers and philosophers,\n",

      "good and real bad, and we will minimize the bad and maximize the good. You have to carry the, the weight of that. How do you avoid GPT4 from being hacked or jailbroken? There's a lot of interesting ways that people have done that, like with token smuggling or other methods. Like Dan, you know, when I was like a. A kid, basically, I. I got worked once on jailbreaking an iPhone. The first iPhone, I think. And I thought it was so cool. I will say it's very strange to be on the other side of that. You're now the man kind of sucks. Is that, is some of it fun? How much of it is a security threat? I mean, what, how much do you have to take it seriously? How is it even possible to solve this problem? Where does it rank on the set of problems? I just keep asking questions, prompting. We want users to have a lot of control and get the model to behave in the way they want within some very broad bounds. And I think the whole reason for jailbreaking is right now we haven't yet figured out how to, like, give that to people. And the more we solve that problem, I think the less need there will be for jailbreaking. Yeah, it's kind of like piracy gave birth to Spotify. People don't really jailbreak iPhones that much anymore. And it's gotten harder, for sure. But also, like, you can just do a lot of stuff now, just like with jailbreaking. I mean, there's a lot of hilarity that ensued. So Evan Murakawa, cool guy, he's at Open AI. He tweeted something that he also was really kind to send me to communicate with me, send me a long email describing the history of OpenAI, all the different developments. He really lays it out. I mean, that's a much longer conversation of all the awesome stuff that happened. It's just amazing. But his Tweet was dolly. July 22 Chad GPT November 22 API 66 cheaper. August 22 Embeddings 500 times cheaper while state of the art. December 22 Chat GPT API also 10 times cheaper while state of the art. March 23 Whisper API March 23 GPT 4 today, whenever that was last week. And the conclusion is this. Team ships, we do what's the process of going and then we can extend that back. I mean, listen, from the 2015 OpenAI launch. GPT GPT 2, GPT 3, OpenAI 5 finals with the gaming stuff, which is incredible. GPT 3 API released, Dolly instruct, GPT tech fine tuning. There's just a million things available. The Dall E, Dall E2 preview and then Dall E available to 1 million people. Whisper second model release. Just across all of the stuff, both research and deployment of actual products that could be in the hands of people. What is the process of going from idea to deployment that allows you to be so successful at shipping AI based products? I mean, there's a question of should we be really proud of that or should other companies be really embarrassed? Yeah, and we believe in a very high bar for the people on the team. We work hard, which, you know, you're not even like supposed to say anymore or something. We give a huge amount of trust and autonomy and authority to individual people and we try to hold each other to very high standards. And you\n",

      "obviously dumb. I think totally the fault of the management team, although I'm not sure what the regulators were thinking either. And is an example of where I think you see the dangers of incentive misalignment because as the Fed kept raising I assume that the incentives on people working at SVB to not sell at a loss their, you know, super safe bonds which were now down 20 or whatever or you know, down less than that but then kept going down, you know that's like a classy example of incentive misalignment. Now I suspect they're not the only bank in a bad position here. The response of the federal government I think took much longer than it should have. But by Sunday afternoon I was glad they had done what they've done. We'll see what happens next. So how do you avoid depositors from doubting their bank? What I think needs would be good to do right now is just a. And this requires statutory change, but it may be a full guarantee of deposits, maybe a much, much higher than 250k. But you really don't want depositors having to doubt the security of their deposits. And this thing that a lot of people on Twitter were saying is like, well, it's their fault. They should have been like, you know, reading the balance sheet and the risk audit of the bank, like, do we really want people to have to do that? I would argue no. What impact has it had on startups that you see? Well, there was a weekend of terror for sure. And now I think even though it was only 10 days ago, it feels like forever and people have forgotten about it. But it kind of reveals the fragility of our economic system. We may not be done. That may have been like the gun shown falling off the nightstand in the first scene of the movie or whatever. There could be like other banks for sure. There could be. Well, even with ftx, I mean, I'm just, well, that's fraud, but there's mismanagement. And you wonder how stable our economic system is, especially with new entrants with AGI. I think one of the many lessons to take away from this SVB thing is how much, how fast and how much the world changes and how little. I think our experts, leaders, business leaders, regulators, whatever, understand it. So the, the speed with which the SVB bank run happened because of Twitter, because of mobile banking apps, whatever, was so different than the 2008 collapse where we didn't have those things really. And I don't think the people in power realized how much the field had shifted. And I think that is a very tiny preview of the shifts that AGI will bring. What gives you hope in that shift? From an economic perspective, that sounds scary. The instability. No, I am nervous about the speed with which this changes and the speed with which our institutions can adapt, which is part of why we want to start deploying these systems really early, why they're really weak, so that people have as much time as possible to do this. I think it's really scary to like have nothing, nothing, nothing, and then drop a super powerful AGI all at once on the world. I don't think people should want that to happen. But what gives me hope is like, I think the less zero, the more positive sum the world gets. The Better. And the. The upside of the vision here, just how much better life can be. I think that's going to like, unite a lot of us. And\n",

      "those people discovered the transistor in the 40s, is this what they were planning on? All of the work, the hundreds of thousands, millions of people, whatever it's been that it took to go from that one first transistor to packing the numbers we do into a chip and figuring out how to wire them all up together and everything else that goes into this, the energy required, the science, like just every step like this is the output of like all of us. And I think that's pretty cool. And before the transistor, there was a hundred billion people who lived and died, had sex, fell in love, ate a lot of good food, murdered each other sometimes rarely, but mostly just good to each other, struggled to survive. And before that there was bacteria and eucariot and all that. And all of that was on this one exponential curve. Yeah. How many others are there, I wonder? We will ask. That is question number one for me, for AGI. How many others? And I'm not sure which answer I want to hear. Sam, you're an incredible person. It's an honor to talk to you. Thank you for the work you're doing. Like I said, I've talked to Ilias Escara, talked to Greg. I talked to so many people at OpenAI. They're really good people. They're doing really interesting work. We are going to try our hardest to get to get to a good place here. I think the challenges are tough. I understand that not everyone agrees with our approach of iterative deployment and also iterative discovery, but it's what we believe in. I think we're making good progress and I think the pace is fast, but so is the progress. So the pace of capabilities and change as fast. But I think that also means we will have new tools to figure out alignment and sort of the capital S safety problem. I feel like we're in this together. I can't wait what we together as a human civilization come up with. It's going to be great. I think we'll work really hard to make sure. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Altman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Alan Turing in 1951.

      "is trying to raise the retirement age? And I think we as a society are confused about whether we want to work more or work less. And certainly about whether most people like their jobs and get value out of their jobs or not. Some people do. I love my job. I suspect you do too. That's a real privilege. Not everybody gets to say that. If we can move more of the world to better jobs and work to something, that can be a broader concept. Not something you have to do to be able to eat, but something you do as a creative expression and a way to find fulfillment and happiness. Whatever else. Even if those jobs look extremely different from the jobs of today, I think that's great. I'm not nervous about it at all. You have been a proponent of UBI Universal Basic Income in the context of AI. Can you describe your philosophy there of. Of our human future with ubi? Why? Why you like it? What are some limitations? I think it is a component of something we should pursue. It is not a full solution. I think people work for lots of reasons besides. And I think we are going to find incredible new jobs and society as a whole. And people's individuals are going to get much, much richer, but as a cushion through a dramatic transition and as. Just like I think the world should eliminate poverty if able to do so. I think it's a great thing to do. As a small part of the bucket of solutions. I helped start a project called worldcoin, which is a technological solution to this. We also have funded a large, I think maybe the largest and most comprehensive universal Basic income study as part of, sponsored by OpenAI. And I think it's an area we should just be looking into. What are some insights from that study that you gained? We're going to finish up at the end of this year and we'll be able to talk about it hopefully early, very early next, if we can linger on it. How do you think the economic and political systems will change as AI becomes a prevalent part of society? It's such an interesting sort of philosophical question looking 10, 20, 50 years from now, what does the economy look like? What does politics look like? Do you see significant transformations in terms of the way democracy functions even? I love that you asked them together because I think they're super related. I think the economic transformation will drive much of the political transformation here, not the other way around. My working model for the last five years has been that the two dominant changes will be that the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy are going over the next couple of decades to dramatically, dramatically fall from where they are today. And the impact of that, and you're already seeing it with the way you now have programming ability beyond what you had as an individual before is society gets much, much richer, much wealthier in ways that are probably hard to imagine. I think every time that's happened before that economic impact has had positive political impact as well. And I think it does go the other way too. The sociopolitical values of the Enlightenment enabled the long running technological revolution and scientific discovery process we've had for the past centuries. But I think we're just going to see more. I'm sure the shape will change, but I think it's this long and beautiful exponential curve. Do you think there will be more? I don't know what the the\n",

We work hard, which, you know, you're not even like supposed to say anymore or something. We give a huge amount of trust and autonomy and authority to individual people and we try to hold each other to very high standards. And you know, there's a process which we can talk about, but it won't be that illuminating. I think it's those other things that make us able to ship at a high velocity. So GPT4 is a pretty complex system. Like you said. There's like a million little hacks you can do to keep improving it. There's cleaning up the data set, all that, all those are like separate teams. So do you give autonomy, is there just autonomy to these fascinating different problems? If, like most people in the company weren't really excited to work super hard and collaborate well on GPT4 and thought other stuff was more important, there'd be very little I or anybody else could do to make it happen. But we spend a lot of time figuring out what to do, getting on the same page about why we're doing something and then how to divide it up and all coordinate together. So then, then you have like a passion for the, for the, for the goal here. So everybody's really passionate across the different teams. Yeah, we care. How do you hire, how do you hire great teams? The folks I've interacted with OpenAI, some of the most amazing folks ever met. It takes a lot of time. Like I, I spend, I mean I think a lot of people claim to spend a third of their time hiring I for real, truly do. I still approve every single hire at OpenAI. And I think there's, you know, we're working on a problem that is like very cool and that great people want to work on. We have great people and so people want to be around them. But even with that, I think there's just no shortcut for putting a ton of effort into this. So even when you have the good people, hard work, I think so. Microsoft announced a new multi year, multi billion dollar reported to be $10 billion investment into OpenAI. Can you describe the thinking that went into this? What are the pros, what are the cons of working with a company like Microsoft? It's not all perfect or easy, but on the whole they have been an amazing partner to us. Satya and Kevin and Mikhail are super aligned with us, super flexible, have gone like way above and beyond the call of duty to do things that we have needed to get all this to work. This is like a big iron, complicated engineering project and they are a big and complex company. And I think like many great partnerships or relationships, we've sort of just continued to ramp up our investment in each other and it's been very good. It's a for profit company, it's very driven, it's very large scale. Is there pressure to kind of make a lot of money? I think most other companies wouldn't. Maybe now they would, it wouldn't at the time have understood why we needed all the weird control provisions we have and why we need all the kind of like AGI specialness. And I know that because I talked to some other companies before we did the first deal with Microsoft\n",

      "lot of people seem really excited about that. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting possibilities. I think you'll discover them I think as you go along. That's the whole point. Like the things you say in this conversation. You might in a year say this was right. No, I may totally want. I may turn out that I love my GPT4. Maybe you want a robot or whatever. Maybe you want your programming assistant to be a little kinder and not mock you. No, I think you do want the style of the way GPT4 talks to you. Yes. Really matters. You probably want something different than what I want but we both probably want something different than the current GPT4 and that will be really important even for a very tool like thing. Is there styles of conversation? Oh no. Contents of conversations you're looking forward to with an AGI like GPT 567. Is there stuff where like where do you go to out outside of the fun meme stuff for actual. I mean what I'm excited for is like please explain to me how all of physics works and solve all remaining mysteries. So like a theory of everything. I'll be real happy. Faster than light travel. Don't you want to know? So there's several things to know. It's like and, and be hard. Is it possible and how to do it? Yeah, I want to know. I want to know. Probably the first question would be are there other intelligent alien civilizations out there? But I don't think AGI has the, the ability to do that to, to, to know that might be able to help us figure out how to go detect. And we need to send some emails to humans and say can you run these experiments? Can you build the space probe? Can you wait a very long time or provide a much better estimate than the Drake equation with the knowledge we already have and maybe process all the. Because we've been collecting a lot of. Yeah, maybe it's in the data. Maybe we need to build better detectors which a really advanced AI could tell us how to do it may not be able to answer it on its Own, but it may be able to tell us what to go build to collect more data. What if it says the aliens are already here? I think I would just go about my life. Yeah. Because I mean, a version of that is like, what are you doing differently now that, like, if GPT4 told you and you believed it, okay, AGI is here, or AGI is coming real soon, what are you going to do differently? The source of joy and happiness, of fulfillment in life is from other humans. So it's mostly nothing unless it causes some kind of threat. But that threat would have to be literally a fire. Are we living now with a greater degree of digital intelligence than you would have expected three years ago in the world? And if you could go back and be told by an oracle three years ago, which is blink of an eye, that In March of 2023 you will be living with this degree of digital intelligence, would you expect your life to be more different than it is right now? Probably, Probably. But there's also a lot of different trajectories intermixed. I would have expected the society's response to a pandemic to be much better, much clearer, less divided. I was very confused about. There's a lot of stuff. Given the amazing technological advancements that are happening, the weird social divisions, it's almost like the more technological advancement there is, the more we're going to be having fun with social division. Or maybe the technological advancement just revealed the division that was already there. But all of that just confuses my understanding of how far along we are as a human civilization and what brings us meaning and how we discover truth together and knowledge and wisdom. So I don't know. But when I look, when I open Wikipedia, I'm happy that humans are able to create this thing. For sure. Yes, there's bias, yes,\n"
