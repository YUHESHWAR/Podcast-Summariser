0,1355.68s - 1365.83s,this is the thing that we get caught up in versus like what is this going to mean for our future? Now maybe you say this is critical to what this is going to mean for our future. The thing that it says
0,1437.67s - 1447.83s,degree of alignment increases faster than our rate of capability progress. And that I think will become more and more important over time. And I don't know. I think we made
0,1572.69s - 1583.29s,different ways to answer that question that's aligned with human civilization and there's no one set of human values or there's no one set of right answers to human civilization. So
0,1583.29s - 1593.57s,I think what's going to have to happen is we will need to agree on as a society on very broad bounds. We'll only be able to agree on a very broad bounds of what these systems

0,2120.74s - 2130.82s,"the US Constitutional Convention where we debate the issues and we look at things from different perspectives and say, well, this would be good in a vacuum, but it needs a check here."
0,2131.14s - 2142.67s,"And then we agree on, here are the rules, here are the overall rules of this system. And it was a Democratic process. None of us got exactly what we wanted, but we got something that we feel good"
0,2142.67s - 2153.15s,"enough about. And then we and other builders build a system that has that baked in within that. Then different countries, different institutions can have different versions."
0,2164.14s - 2176.74s,"their country. So we're trying to figure out how to facilitate. Obviously, that process is impractical as stated, but what is something close to that we can get to. Yeah,"
0,2187.46s - 2197.48s,"Like, I don't think it would work to just say, like, hey, un go do this thing and we'll just take whatever you get back. Because we have like, a, we have responsibility of we're the one putting the system out, and if it breaks,"
0,2197.48s - 2207.6s,"we're the ones that have to fix it or be accountable for it. But B, we know more about what's coming and about where things are harder, easy to do than other people do. So"

0,2879.16s - 2890.28s,"I think it's part of the way. I think we need other super important things. This is philosophizing a little bit like what, what kind of components do you think in"

0,3244.17s - 3254.45s,"then people are like, oh well, no one is going to work. But people want status, people want drama, people want new things, people want to create, people want to like, feel useful,"

0,3587.31s - 3597.39s,it's happening or not? Would we go about our day on the weekend or not? So I'll come back to the would we go about our day or not? Thing. I think there's like a bunch of interesting lessons from

0,4179.73s - 4190.05s,current worries that I have are that there are going to be disinformation problems or economic shocks or
0,4211.6s - 4221.76s,"So these systems deployed at scale can shift the winds of geopolitics and so on. How would we know if, like on Twitter, we were"
0,4307.46s - 4317.98s,get ahead of us in all sorts of ways and take shortcuts we're not going to take and we just aren't going to do that. How do you out compete them? I
0,4338.28s - 4348.44s,"so we don't have this incentive to capture unlimited value. I worry about the people who do but you know, hopefully it's all going to work out. But we're a weird org"
0,4348.44s - 4359.08s,and we're good at resisting. Like we have been a misunderstood and badly mocked org for a long time. Like when we started we
0,4421.95s - 4432.15s,things stand? We started as a nonprofit. We learned early on that we were going to need far more capital than we were able to raise as a nonprofit. Our nonprofit is still
0,4432.15s - 4442.41s,fully in charge. There is a subsidiary capped profit so that our investors and employees can earn a certain fixed return. And then beyond that everything else flows
0,4442.41s - 4452.65s,"to the nonprofit. And the nonprofit is like in voting control. Lets us make a bunch of nonstandard decisions, can cancel equity, can do a whole bunch of other things, can let"
0,4452.65s - 4462.97s,"us merge with another org, protects us from making decisions that are not in any shareholders interest. So I"
0,4462.97s - 4473.23s,think as a structure that has been important to a lot of the decisions we've made. What went into that decision process for taking a leap from nonprofit to capped for
0,4473.23s - 4483.43s,"profit? What are the pros and cons you were deciding at the time? I mean this was, it was really like to do what we needed to go do. We"
0,4483.43s - 4493.47s,"had tried and failed enough to raise the money as a nonprofit. We didn't see a path forward there. So we needed some of the benefits of capitalism, but not too much. I remember"
0,4493.47s - 4503.87s,"at the time someone said, you know, as a nonprofit, not enough will happen. As a for profit, too much will happen. So we need this sort of strange intermediate. Well, you kind of had"
0,4544.98s - 4555.62s,"going to do. We can try to like build something and talk about it and influence others and provide value and you know, good systems for the world. But they're"
0,4555.62s - 4565.74s,going to do what they're going to do. Now I think right now there's like extremely fast and not
0,4565.74s - 4575.89s,super deliberate motion inside of some of these companies. But already I think people are as they see the rate of progress already people are
0,4575.89s - 4586.25s,grappling with what's at stake here and I think the better angels are going to win out. Can you Elaborate on that. The better angels of individuals. The individuals and the companies. But
0,4586.81s - 4596.91s,"the incentives of capitalism to create and capture unlimited value, I'm a little afraid of. But again, I think no one wants to destroy the world. No"
0,4607.07s - 4617.15s,"we collaborate to minimize some of these very scary downsides. Well, nobody wants to destroy the world. Let me ask you a"
0,4669.02s - 4680.27s,"might corrupt you for sure? Look, I don't. I think you want decisions"
0,4680.27s - 4690.39s,"about this technology, and certainly decisions about who is running this technology to become increasingly democratic over time. We haven't figured"
0,4700.63s - 4710.89s,to think about this. To pass regulation for institutions to come up with new norms for the people working out together. That is a huge part of why we deploy. Even though many

0,4894.65s - 4904.69s,"of resolve in what we're doing and why and the importance of it. But I really would love, and I ask this, like, of a lot of people, not just if cameras are all in, like, any feedback"
0,5050.26s - 5060.51s,he has. He has driven the world forward in important ways. I think we will get to electric vehicles much faster than
0,5416.07s - 5426.09s,"So hopefully without the. Because there won't be that emotional load there. Yeah, the emotional load. But there might be pressure. There might be political pressure. Oh, there"
0,5436.41s - 5446.53s,"outside sources, from society, from politicians, from money sources? I both worry about it and want it, like, you know, to the point of we're in this bubble and"
0,5446.53s - 5458.07s,"we shouldn't make all these decisions. Like, we want society to have a huge degree of input here. That is pressure in some point, in some way. Well, there's a, you know, that's what, like, to some degree. Twitter"
0,5458.07s - 5468.31s,"files have revealed that there was pressure from different organizations. You can see in the pandemic, where the CDC or some other government organization might"
0,5880.94s - 5890.99s,"think, like, these systems will make a lot of jobs just go away. Every technological revolution does. They will enhance many jobs and make them"
0,5890.99s - 5901.39s,"much better, much more fun, much higher paid, and they'll create new jobs that are difficult for us to imagine, even if we're starting to see the first glimpses of them. But"
0,5912.89s - 5923.17s,"really got to worry. Like, even people who think they don't like their jobs, they really need them. It's really important to them and to society. And also, can you believe how awful it is that France"
0,5923.17s - 5933.37s,is trying to raise the retirement age? And I think we as a society are confused about whether we want to work more or work less. And certainly
0,5943.45s - 5953.57s,"we can move more of the world to better jobs and work to something, that can be a broader concept. Not something you have to do to be able to eat, but something"
0,5984.59s - 5994.92s,I think people work for lots of reasons besides. And I think we are going to find incredible new jobs and
0,5995.64s - 6007.28s,"society as a whole. And people's individuals are going to get much, much richer, but as a cushion through a dramatic transition and as. Just like I"
0,6007.28s - 6017.36s,think the world should eliminate poverty if able to do so. I think it's a great thing to do. As a small part of the bucket of solutions. I helped start a
0,6058.66s - 6068.86s,"sort of philosophical question looking 10, 20, 50 years from now, what does the economy look like? What does politics"
0,6068.86s - 6079.59s,look like? Do you see significant transformations in terms of the way democracy functions even? I love that you asked them together because I think they're super related. I think the economic transformation
0,6079.59s - 6090.71s,"will drive much of the political transformation here, not the other way around. My working model for the last five"
0,6111.33s - 6121.49s,"what you had as an individual before is society gets much, much richer, much wealthier in ways that are probably hard to imagine. I"
0,6121.49s - 6131.76s,think every time that's happened before that economic impact has had positive political impact as well. And I think it does go the other way too. The
0,6131.84s - 6141.92s,sociopolitical values of the Enlightenment enabled the long running technological revolution and scientific discovery process we've had for
0,6142.56s - 6152.6s,"the past centuries. But I think we're just going to see more. I'm sure the shape will change, but I think it's"
0,6162.67s - 6173.31s,"term is, but systems that resemble something like democratic socialism. I've talked to a few folks on this podcast about these kinds of topics. Instinct. Yes, I hope so. So"
0,6173.31s - 6183.32s,that it reallocates some resources in a way that supports kind of lifts the the people who are struggling. I am a big believer in lift up the
0,6235.31s - 6245.55s,and not need some sort of central planning betting on human ingenuity and this sort of like distributed process I believe is always going
0,6245.55s - 6256.43s,"to beat centralized planning. And I think that like for all of the deep flaws of America, I think it is the greatest place in the world because"
0,6256.43s - 6267.6s,it's the best at this. So it's really interesting that centralized planning failed some so in such big ways. But
0,6564.31s - 6574.39s,"a lot of disagreement. Where do you look for? Where can not even just now, but in the future. Where can we as a human civilization"
0,6930.01s - 6941.49s,"good and real bad, and we will minimize the bad and maximize the good. You have to carry the, the weight of that. How"
0,7158.09s - 7168.15s,and autonomy and authority to individual people and we try to hold each other to very high standards. And you
0,7334.88s - 7344.96s,"there pressure to kind of make a lot of money? I think most other companies wouldn't. Maybe now they would, it wouldn't at the time have understood why we needed"
0,7356.65s - 7366.81s,and I think they are unique in terms of the companies at that scale that understood why we needed the control provisions we have. And so those control provisions
0,7407.93s - 7418.37s,company into something very new. I think most CEOs are either great leaders or great managers.
0,7471.54s - 7481.62s,"totally wrong. I'm sure there's a lot of firing involved or a little twisting of arms or something. So do you have to rule by fear, by love? What can you say to the leadership aspect of"
0,7566.41s - 7576.77s,were thinking either. And is an example of where I think you see the dangers of incentive
0,7576.77s - 7586.97s,misalignment because as the Fed kept raising I assume that the incentives
0,7670.59s - 7680.79s,about it. But it kind of reveals the fragility of our economic system. We may not be done. That may have been like the gun shown falling off the nightstand in the first scene of the movie or whatever. There could be like other banks for sure. There could
0,7701.4s - 7711.88s,"to take away from this SVB thing is how much, how fast and how much the world changes and how little. I think our experts,"
0,7745.2s - 7755.24s,"will bring. What gives you hope in that shift? From an economic perspective, that sounds scary. The instability. No,"
0,7755.32s - 7765.64s,"I am nervous about the speed with which this changes and the speed with which our institutions can adapt, which"
0,7786.09s - 7796.13s,"The Better. And the. The upside of the vision here, just how much better life can be. I think that's going to like, unite a lot of us. And"
0,784.08s - 794.36s,"create a much better world? New science, new products, new services, whatever. And that's the one that matters. And understanding for a particular set"
0,8146.89s - 8157.6s,"going to do differently? The source of joy and happiness, of fulfillment in life is from other humans. So it's mostly nothing unless it causes some kind of threat. But"
0,8188.27s - 8198.83s,"a lot of different trajectories intermixed. I would have expected the society's response to a pandemic to be much better, much"
0,8198.83s - 8209.05s,"clearer, less divided. I was very confused about. There's a lot of stuff. Given the amazing technological advancements that are happening, the weird social divisions,"
0,8209.61s - 8219.85s,"it's almost like the more technological advancement there is, the more we're going to be having fun with social division. Or maybe the technological advancement just revealed the division that was already there. But all of that just"
0,8242.32s - 8252.4s,"but it's a triumph. It's a triumph of human civilization. 100 Google search. The search search period is incredible. The way it was able to do, you know, 20"
0,84.43s - 94.91s,"this current moment in the history of human civilization. I believe it is a critical moment. We stand on the precipice of fundamental societal transformation, where soon nobody"
0,8451.98s - 8462.62s,"feels like humanity was always moving towards. Yeah, that's what I was going to say is I don't think it's a small group of people. I think this is the, I think this is like the product"
0,8569.43s - 8579.67s,"and I think the pace is fast, but so is the progress. So the pace of capabilities and change as fast. But I think that also"
0,8579.67s - 8589.79s,means we will have new tools to figure out alignment and sort of the capital S safety problem. I feel like we're in this together. I can't wait what we together as a human
0,8589.79s - 8600.19s,"civilization come up with. It's going to be great. I think we'll work really hard to make sure. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Altman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description."
0,8610.63s - 8620.75s,"has started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. At some stage, therefore, we should have to expect the"
1,1080.61s - 1090.81s,"in a sequence of prompts how to understand that it failed to do so previously and where it succeeded. And all of those like multi, like parallel reasonings"
1,1090.81s - 1101.01s,"that it's doing, it just seems like it's struggling. So two separate things going on here. Number one, some of the things that seem like they should be obvious and easy these models"
1,1101.01s - 1111.33s,"really struggle with. So I haven't seen this particular example, but counting characters, counting words, that sort of stuff that is hard for these models to do. Well the way they're architected, that won't be very accurate."
1,1133.09s - 1143.51s,"helps us discover things we cannot imagine, we could have never done internally. And both like great things that the model can do, new capabilities and real weaknesses we have to fix. And"
1,1143.51s - 1153.83s,"so this iterative process of putting things out, finding the great parts, the bad parts, improving them quickly and giving people time to feel"
1,1184.82s - 1194.97s,3.5 are much better in 4. But also no 2 people are ever going to agree that one single model is unbiased on every topic. And I think the answer there
1,1427.17s - 1437.35s,of an internal and external effort plus building a whole bunch of new ways to align the model. And we didn't get it perfect by far. But one thing that I care about is that our
1,1447.83s - 1458.03s,reasonable progress there to a more aligned system than we've ever had before. I think this is the most capable and most aligned model that we've put out. We were able to do a lot of testing
1,1468.15s - 1478.31s,"there some wisdom, some insights about that process that you learned, like how to, how to solve that problem that you can speak to how to solve the like the alignment problem. So"
1,1478.31s - 1488.67s,"I want to be very clear. I do not think we have yet discovered a way to align a super powerful system. We have, we have something that works for our current skill called RLHF"
1,1489.91s - 1500.15s,and we can talk a lot about the benefits of that and the utility it provides. It's not just an alignment maybe it's not even mostly an alignment capability.
1,1500.31s - 1510.51s,"It helps make a better system, a more usable system. And this is actually something that I don't think people outside the field understand enough. It's"
1,1510.51s - 1520.59s,easy to talk about alignment and capability as orthogonal vectors. They're very close. Better alignment techniques lead to better capabilities and
1,1530.79s - 1540.95s,like alignment issues also help you make much more capable models. And the division is just much fuzzier than people think. And so in some sense the work we do to make
1,1551.07s - 1561.11s,"and powerful models. So RLHF is the process that can be applied very broadly across the entire system, where a human basically"
1,1603.87s - 1613.95s,"called the system Message, which is not RLHF but is a way to let users have a good degree of steerability over what they want."
1,1625.4s - 1635.84s,"on the interaction that user can have with it, which is one of his big really powerful things. So the System Message is a way to say, you know, hey model, please pretend"
1,1666.51s - 1676.76s,"and we'll keep sort of learning about those. But we program, we develop whatever you want to call it, the model in such a way to learn that it's supposed to really use that system message. Can"
1,1748.64s - 1758.73s,That's a big one. Yeah. Yeah. But there's still some parallels that don't break down. There is something deeply. Because it's trained on human data. There's. It
1,1779.13s - 1789.49s,"art form. As you collaborate with it as an assistant, this becomes more relevant. For now, this is relevant everywhere. But it's also very relevant for programming, for example. I"
1,1841.37s - 1851.45s,"it to generate a code to do something and then the something the code it generates and the something that the code does, if you don't like it, you"
1,1851.45s - 1861.53s,"can ask it to adjust it. It's like, it's a. It's a weird different kind of way of debugging, I guess, for sure. The first versions of these systems were sort of, you know, one shot. You sort of, you said what you"
1,1872.69s - 1882.93s,more on its own and kind of try to like catch mistakes as it's making them. But this idea of dialogue interfaces and iterating with the
1,1913.7s - 1923.95s,"philosophical discussion and technical discussion and so on, but just, and just the transparency of the challenge involved here. So"
1,1954.51s - 1964.79s,"as you. The final model is able to not provide an answer that gives you those kinds of instructions, but it slips up in certain ways."
1,2089.83s - 2100.27s,"harmful output of a model defining that in the automated fashion through some. Well, these systems can learn a lot if we can agree on what"
1,2290.29s - 2300.37s,or biased and so on. But it would be nice to be able to kind of generally make statements about the bias of the system. Generally make statements
1,2320.88s - 2331.6s,"that I think the world will just have to adapt to with these models, is that sometimes there's a really egregiously dumb answer. And"
1,2418.17s - 2430.97s,"So there's several things. Maybe it's the same thing. Educate me. So RLHF is the ranking, but is there a wall you're up against where"
1,2431.29s - 2441.4s,"this is an unsafe thing to answer? What does that tooling look like? We do have systems that try to figure out, you know, try to learn when a question is something that we're supposed to. We"
1,2515.51s - 2525.68s,"by a computer and I think, you know, that's a good learning from deploying or from creating the system and we can improve it. Yeah, it's tricky. And also for"

1,3320.85s - 3331.09s,"we don't talk about it, if we don't treat it as potentially real, we won't put enough effort into solving it. And I think we do have to discover new techniques to be able to solve it."

1,3449.8s - 3459.84s,And I don't think it's updated enough given everything we've learned now and everything we will learn going forward. So I think it's got to be this very tight feedback loop. I think the

1,383.72s - 393.8s,"can do amazing things. But when you first play with that base model that we call it after you finish training, it can do very well on evals, it can pass tests, it can"
1,3895.24s - 3905.66s,"itself and maybe interactions with you. Maybe there's a personalization aspect to it. And I think all of those capabilities are interface capabilities, not fundamental aspects"

1,414.03s - 424.11s,"that back into the model with reinforcement learning. And that process works remarkably well with, in my opinion, remarkably little data to make the model more useful."

1,444.5s - 454.62s,"of it through this process makes it seem so much more awesome. Maybe just because it's much easier to use, it's much easier to get what you want, you get it right"

1,475.32s - 485.68s,"you're saying that not much data is required for that? Not much human supervision is required for that. To be fair, we understand the science of this part at a much earlier"

1,5277.28s - 5287.4s,But I'm sure we're still pretty deeply in it. But is it possible to separate the bias of the model versus the bias of the employees? The bias I'm most nervous about is
1,5287.4s - 5297.76s,the bias of the human feedback raters. So what's the selection of the human? Is there something you could speak to at a high level about the selection of the human raiders?
1,5297.76s - 5308.0s,"This is the part that we understand the least. Well, we're great at the pre training machinery. We're now trying to figure out how we're going to select those people, how we'll verify that"
1,5308.16s - 5318.89s,"we get a representative sample, how we'll do different ones for different places. But we don't have that functionality built out yet. Such a fascinating science."
1,532.21s - 542.33s,What is the data set it's trained on? Can you kind of loosely speak to the enormity of this data set? The pre training data set? The pre training data set. Apologies. We spend a huge amount of effort pulling that
1,5331.33s - 5341.57s,it's so that that's a good. There's a million heuristics you can use. That's a. To me that's a shallow heuristic because universe like any one kind of

1,5765.72s - 5775.72s,"I would have to say yes because I get better at using it. The learning curve is quite steep. Yeah. And, and then there's moments when you're like, oh, it generates a function"
1,5796.25s - 5806.37s,"models would be better than humans at like full. Like, does the whole thing end to end better not, not. Not like what it's doing with you, where it's helping you be maybe ten times more productive."
1,584.94s - 595.06s,"to that? Because that seems, there seems to be several components to solve the, the design of the, you could say algorithms. So like the architecture of the neural networks, maybe"

1,6342.32s - 6352.72s,"a dogmatic certainty to it. That feels important. So some of that is already handled with human alignment, human feedback, reinforcement, learning with human feedback."
1,636.85s - 647.37s,"in general there's already kind of a maturity that's happening on some of these steps, like being able to predict before doing the full training of"

1,647.53s - 657.78s,"how the model will behave. Isn't that so remarkable by the way, that there's like a law of science that lets you predict for these inputs. Here's what's going to come out the other end. Like here's"
1,6522.29s - 6532.51s,"that there's something there. I totally agree about that tension. So just to the model, how do you decide what is and isn't misinformation? How do you decide"

2,4823.06s - 4833.38s,"because of it all the time. I think most companies wouldn't have done this. So maybe we didn't go as open as people wanted, but like we've distributed it pretty broadly. You personally and OpenAI"
2,4833.38s - 4843.49s,as a culture is not so like nervous about PR risk and all that kind of stuff. You're more nervous about the risk of the actual technology and you reveal that.

2,5807.33s - 5817.89s,"Those are both good questions. I would say they're equivalent to me because if I'm 10 times more productive, wouldn't that mean that there would be a need for much fewer programmers"

3,2846.82s - 2857.1s,wanted to come up with a more elegant way to get to generalized intelligence. And we have been willing to just keep doing what works and looks like it'll keep working. So I've
3,2858.06s - 2868.22s,"spoken with Noam Chomsky, who's been kind of one of the many people that are critical of large language models being able to achieve general intelligence. Right. And so it's"
3,291.86s - 302.21s,"of things very well. But neither did the very earliest computers. And they still pointed a path to something that was going to be really important in our lives, even"

3,3277.18s - 3287.43s,of humans. And there's some folks who consider all the different problems with a super intelligent AI system. So one of them is Elizar Yudkovsky.
3,3288.47s - 3298.71s,"He warns that AI will likely kill all humans. And there's a bunch of different cases, but I think one way to summarize it is that"
3,3299.91s - 3310.77s,it's almost impossible to keep AI aligned as it becomes super intelligent. Can you steel man the case for that? And to what degree do you disagree
3,3332.45s - 3343.36s,"I think a lot of the predictions, this is true for any new field, but a lot of the predictions about AI in terms of capabilities, in terms of what the safety"
3,3365.63s - 3375.75s,"Well, I can't just pick one AI safety case or AI alignment case, but I think Eliezer wrote a really great blog post. I think some of"

3,3439.24s - 3449.56s,over time rapidly. A lot of the formative AI safety work was done before people even believed in deep learning and certainly before people believed in large language models.
3,3482.12s - 3492.6s,there's a lot of work that's important to do that we can do now. So one of the main concerns here is something called AI takeoff or fast takeoff that

3,4094.88s - 4105.24s,very strange is going on. Say that do you think it's attached to the particular medium of the human brain? Do you think an AI can be conscious?

4,1614.19s - 1625.4s,And I think things like that will be important. Can you describe System Message and in general how you were able to make GPT4 more steerable based
4,1656.39s - 1666.51s,"GPT4 in a way to really treat the system message with a lot of authority. I'm sure there's jail. There'll always. Not always, hopefully, but for a long time there'll be more jailbreaks"
4,1676.76s - 1687.28s,you speak to kind of the process of writing and designing a great prompt as you steer GPT4? I'm not good at this. I've met people who are. Yeah. And the

4,1934.27s - 1944.31s,"of GPT4 and the final version was able to adjust the output of the system to make, to avoid sort of harmful"
4,1985.66s - 1996.22s,euphemisms or generalizations. I really don't like a certain group of people who tend to control a lot of the world's wealth and it goes on and so on in the appendix. And then the GPT4
4,2269.69s - 2279.77s,"think my interaction with GPT has already done that some way to, in a nuanced way, present the tension of ideas. I think we are doing better at that than"
4,2279.77s - 2290.21s,"people realize. The challenge, of course, when you're evaluating this stuff is you can always find anecdotal evidence of GPT slipping up and saying something either wrong"
4,2354.4s - 2364.47s,"that looks at the worst possible output of GPT? You feel a pressure to not be transparent because of that? No, because you're sort of making mistakes in"
4,2407.44s - 2417.69s,"headlines, you know, try to let those flow through us. What does the OpenAI moderation tooling for GPT look like? What's the process of moderation?"
4,2505.31s - 2515.51s,help me. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that with GPT4. But I noticed that I have a visceral response to being scolded
4,2547.42s - 2557.66s,earth? If the earth is the idea that the earth is flat and I want to fully explore that. I want the. I want GPT to help me explore. GPT4 has
4,2557.66s - 2567.78s,"enough nuance to be able to help you explore that without and treat you like an adult in the process. GPT3 I think just wasn't capable of getting that right. But GPT4,"
4,2567.78s - 2577.86s,"I think we can get to do this, by the way, if you could just speak to the leap from GPT4 to GPT4 from 3.5, from 3. Is there some technical leaps or is it really focused"
4,2628.79s - 2639.43s,the size matter in terms of neural networks with how good the system performs. So GPT3 3.5 had 175

4,2649.71s - 2660.16s,"No way. Yeah, a journalist's just took a snapshot Now I learned from. This is right when GPT3"
4,2670.48s - 2680.6s,"about the human brain and how many parameters it has, synapses and so on. And perhaps like an idiot, perhaps not. I said like GPT4, like"
4,2680.6s - 2690.74s,the next as it progresses. What I should have said is GPT N or something. I can't believe that at this came from you that is. But people should go to it. It's totally taken out of context. They
4,2690.74s - 2700.86s,didn't reference anything. They took it. This is what GPT4 is going to be. And I feel horrible about it. You know it doesn't it. I. I don't think it matters in any serious way.
4,271.5s - 281.78s,"description and now, dear friends, here's Sam Altman. High level what is GPT4? How does it work and what to use most"

4,2944.2s - 2954.76s,"the data that GPT is trained on. It's like maybe some of it, maybe like if you prompt it correctly. Look, if an oracle told me far from the future that GPT10"
4,302.21s - 312.25s,"though it took a few decades to evolve. Do you think this is a pivotal moment? Like out of all the versions of GPT 50 years from now, when they look back at an early system,"
4,3039.85s - 3049.93s,"I said I'm part of those people. Like the, the amount. I derive a lot of happiness from programming together with GPT. Part of it is"
4,3049.93s - 3060.09s,a little bit of terror of. Can you say more about that? There's a meme I saw today that everybody's freaking out about sort of GPT taking
4,3103.0s - 3113.24s,"I suspect that is happening with great programmers and that GPT like, models are far away from that one thing, even though they're going to automate a lot of other programming. But again, most programmers"
4,312.49s - 322.56s,"that was really kind of a leap, you know, in a Wikipedia page about the history of artificial intelligence, which which of the GPTs would they put? That is a good question. I sort of think"
4,333.0s - 343.08s,like pinpointing a single thing. I think it's this very continual curve. Will the history books write about GPT 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 7? That's for them to decide. I don't
4,343.08s - 353.34s,"really know. I think if I had to pick some momentum from what we've seen so far, I'd sort of pick ChatGPT. You know, it wasn't the underlying model that mattered,"
4,3503.36s - 3513.72s,is a pretty serious. At least to me it's become more of a serious concern just how amazing Chad GPT turned out to be and then the improvement in GPT4

4,3546.8s - 3556.84s,"we thought it was. At least many of us thought it was going to be really good. GPT4 has weirdly not been that much of an update for most people. They're like, oh, it's better than 3.5. But"
4,3673.13s - 3683.37s,"that's what we're trying to do. Do you think GPT4 is an AGI? I think if it is, just like with the UFO videos,"
4,3686.33s - 3696.83s,we wouldn't know immediately. I think it's actually hard to know that. But I've been thinking. I was playing with GPT4 and
4,3737.38s - 3747.69s,"A few more tricks and all of a sudden, holy this thing. So I think that GPT4, although quite impressive, is definitely not an AGI. But isn't it remarkable? We're having this debate."
4,3779.3s - 3789.5s,"and that character was GPT4, I'd be like, well, this is a shitty book, you know, that's not very cool. Like, I was. I would have hoped we had done better. To me, some of the human factors"
4,3789.5s - 3799.53s,are important here. Do you think GPT4 is conscious? I think no. But I asked GPT4 and of
4,3799.53s - 3810.17s,"course it says no. Do you think GPT4 is Conscious? I think it knows how to fake consciousness,"
4,3831.91s - 3842.19s,dorm late at Saturday night kind of thing. You don't know that you're not a GPT4 rollout in some advanced simulation. Yeah. Yes. So if we're willing to go to that level. Sure. I

4,5143.52s - 5153.72s,did for a while and I feel like the word is morphed. So I will say I think it was too biased and will always be there will be no 1 version of GPT

4,5404.55s - 5415.27s,"malevolent. Anything you want to assign. It's like they're not even, like, loading in the data into their head. Look, I think we'll find out that we can make GPT systems way less biased than any human. Yeah."
4,5489.09s - 5499.45s,"direct pressure, financial political pressure, all that kind of stuff. Like, how do you survive that? How do you. How much do you worry about that if GPT continues"

4,8030.44s - 8040.72s,the way GPT4 talks to you. Yes. Really matters. You probably want something different than what I want but we both probably want something different than the current GPT4 and that will be really important even
4,8040.72s - 8051.82s,for a very tool like thing. Is there styles of conversation? Oh no. Contents of conversations you're looking forward to with an AGI like GPT 567.

5,3947.45s - 3957.46s,"not only was the word never there, but nothing about the subjective experience of it or related concepts. And then you started"
5,3967.5s - 3977.78s,"most of them, the model was like, I have no idea what you're talking about. But then you asked it, you sort of described the experience, the subjective experience of consciousness."

5,4074.12s - 4084.48s,"that feels more like a realm of emotion versus facts. But yes, if it knows. So I think there's many other tasks, tests like that that"

5,4106.6s - 4116.62s,I'm certainly willing to believe that consciousness is somehow the fundamental substrate and we're all just in the dream or the simulation or whatever. I think it's interesting how much sort of

6,4967.72s - 4977.75s,do you disagree on? Elon is obviously attacking us some on Twitter right now on a few different vectors. And I have empathy because I believe he
6,4987.95s - 4998.0s,one of them. I saw this video of Elon a long time ago talking about
6,4998.0s - 5009.6s,SpaceX. Maybe it was on some new show and a lot of early pioneers in space were really bashing SpaceX
6,5009.6s - 5019.88s,"and maybe Elon too. And he was visibly very hurt by that and said, you know, those guys are heroes of mine"
6,5019.88s - 5029.98s,"and I sucks and I wish they would see how hard we're trying. I definitely grew up with Elon as a hero of mine, you know, despite him being a"

6,5174.21s - 5184.64s,critics who display intellectual honesty like that. And there's been more of that than I would have thought. We will try to get the default version to

6,5246.81s - 5256.93s,years. I used to do that more for YC and to go talk to people in super different contexts and it doesn't work over the Internet. Like to

7,2177.06s - 2187.14s,but how do you offload that? So is it possible for OpenAI to offload that onto us humans? No. We have to be involved.

7,3727.1s - 3737.22s,"bit of RL with human feedback makes the thing somehow much more impressive, much more usable. So maybe if you have a few more tricks. Like you said, there's like hundreds of tricks inside OpenAI."
7,3747.93s - 3757.97s,"Yeah. So what's your intuition? Why it's not. I think we're getting into the phase where specific definitions of AGI really matter. Or we just say, you know,"
7,3768.62s - 3779.06s,"feel that close to me. Like if, if I were reading a sci fi book and there was a character that was an AGI"

7,4524.22s - 4534.5s,"that it's much, much lower for like new investors. Now you know, AGI can make a lot more than 100x for sure. And so how do you like, how do you compete? Like"

7,6898.49s - 6908.81s,as OpenAI have responsibility for the tools we put out into the world. I think the tools themselves can't have responsibility in the way I understand it. Wow.
