[1741.53s - 1992.69s] GPT4 was released six days ago. How do you think GPT4 and all the advancements with GPT change the nature of programming? I think this is where we'll see some of the most impact.

[5697.89s - 5948.01s] There's a lot of like little, little things and, and big things that are just really good about VS code size. I can happily report in all the event people are just going nuts. But I'm very happy. It was a very happy decision. But there was a lot

[4624.14s - 4874.19s] OpenAI founder: "I don't want like super voting power or any special like, then, you know, like control of the board or anything like that of OpenAI" "I think you want decisions about this technology to become increasingly democratic over time," he says.

[7550.59s - 7800.79s] The SVB bank run is an example of the dangers of incentive misalignment. The response of the federal government I think took much longer than it should have. The speed with which the bank run happened was so different than the 2008 collapse.

[7964.9s - 8214.98s] There are going to be very interactive GPT4 powered pets or whatever robots companions and a lot of people seem really excited about that. I'm very drawn to that. You probably want something different than what I want but we both probably wantsomething different than the current G PT4.

[7996.1s - 8246.17s] GPT 567 is the latest version of the GPT4, a computer program designed to talk to an artificial intelligence. GPT567 will be able to answer questions such as whether there are other intelligent alien civilizations out there and how to detect them.

[6180.28s - 6430.48s] I recoil at the idea of living in a communist system. I think like more individualism, more human will, more ability to self determine is important. And I think that for all of the deep flaws of America, I think it is the greatest place in the world because it's

[1181.75s - 1431.81s] GPT4 is a computer model that tries to give users more personalized control, granular control over time. When I was a little kid, I thought building AI would be like the coolest thing ever. I never, never really thought I would get the chance to work on it.

[1202.01s - 1452.56s] GPT4 is a computer model that tries to predict the future of the world. It has been used by Twitter to test its algorithms. The model has been criticized for being too simplistic.

[2067.46s - 2317.48s] OpenAI is trying to figure out how to facilitate the debate about free speech absolutism in an AI system. "We have to be involved, heavily involved, and we've got to be responsible in some sense," he says.

[5422.28s - 5672.4s] The CEO of OpenAI says he worries about pressure from outside sources, from society, from politicians, from money sources. He also says he's not a great spokesperson for the AI movement.

[7528.11s - 7780.51s] SVB was "horribly mismanaged buying while chasing returns in a very silly world of zero percent interest rates," he says. The response of the federal government I think took much longer than it should have, he adds.

[1171.63s - 1421.75s] GPT4 is a new version of Google's AI system. It's designed to give users more personalized control, granular control over time. When it launched with 3.5 was not something that I certainly felt proud of, but it's gotten much better with 4.

[4259.53s - 4509.54s] OpenAI has been a misunderstood and badly mocked org for a long time. We have a very unusual structure so we don't have this incentive to capture unlimited value. I worry about the people who do but you know, hopefully it's all going to work out.

[7130.05s - 7380.49s] OpenAI is working on a problem that is like very cool and that great people want to work on. We give a huge amount of trust and autonomy and authority to individual people and we try to hold each other to very high standards. I still approve every single hire at OpenAI.

[1235.68s - 1485.83s] When I was a little kid, I thought building AI would be like the coolest thing ever. I never, never really thought I would get the chance to work on it. If you hand people an AGI and that's what they want to do, I wouldn't have believed you

[1731.45s - 1981.53s] GPT4 is an advanced version of Google's GPT, a programming tool that uses AI to help programmers. The tool was released six days ago, but it's already had a huge impact on programming, says GPT CEO.

[2519.43s - 2769.55s] GPT4 has enough nuance to be able to help you explore that without and treat you like an adult in the process. Treating our users like adults is a thing I say very frequently inside, inside the office. It has to do with language.

[2865.41s - 3115.57s] GPT10 is a language model that can be trained on large amounts of data. It's been six days since it was trained. Do you think large language models really is the way we build cgi? I think it's part of the way.

[4744.46s - 4994.5s] OpenAI chief: "I know a lot of folks at OpenAI. The thing I really like is the transparency" "We're in uncharted waters here. Talking to smart people is important"
